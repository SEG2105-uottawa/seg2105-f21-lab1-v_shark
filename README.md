# seg2105-f21-lab1-v_shark  

After I pulled from remote repository, there was a message indicated that auto merge failed and there was a merge conflict on team.txt.
I was asked to manually solve the conflcit which lead the current branch's name to be "(master|MERGING)".
So I opened and team.txt and removed system message (eg. >>head),added and commited the file, push to remote repository afterward.
